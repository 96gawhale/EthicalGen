Introduction
For this assignment, the goal was to develop an effective document summarization pipeline using large language models (LLMs). Document summarization is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves condensing a document into a shorter form while retaining its essential information. I chose model BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers)for this task, which is known for its capability in text generation and summarization.

Methodology
Document Selection
As for document selection a paragraph from one of the Harry Potter books is used. This document is concise and substantial for demonstration that the program will generate a proper summary using the necessary tools.

LLM Selection
Selected Model:

Model: facebook/bart-large-cnn
Justification:
Capabilities: BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) is effective for text generation and summarization tasks. It combines the strengths of both bidirectional context (from BERT) and autoregressive text generation (from GPT).
Suitability: BART's architecture is particularly well-suited for summarization tasks due to its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant summaries. Its pre-trained model, facebook/bart-large-cnn, is fine-tuned on summarization tasks, making it a strong choice for this assignment.

Chunking Strategy

Chunk Size:
Maximum Length: BART has a token limit of 1024 tokens. For documents longer than this limit, we divide them into chunks of up to 1000 tokens to ensure adequate space for tokenization and model overhead.
Implementation:
Tokenization: The document is tokenized into chunks that fit within BARTâ€™s token limit.
Processing: Each chunk is processed separately to generate summaries.
Combining: The summaries of individual chunks are combined to produce a final summary.
Reasoning:

Effectiveness: This approach ensures that the entire document is processed without losing crucial information. Chunking helps in managing long documents that exceed the model's token limit, while the map-reduce approach ensures that the context within each chunk is preserved.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summarization Technique
Technique Implemented:

Approach: Map-Reduce Summarization
Map: Summarize each chunk individually.
Reduce: Combine these summaries to form a final cohesive summary.
Comparison:

Stuffing:
Pros: Simple to implement. Suitable for short documents.
Cons: May lose context and coherence if the document is long and not all information fits within the token limit.
Map-Reduce:
Pros: Maintains context better by processing and summarizing smaller parts of the document separately.
Cons: More complex, as it requires combining summaries from multiple chunks.

Prompt Engineering
Defined Prompts:

Abstract: "Generate a concise abstract for the following text: {document}"
Summary: "Summarize the following text in detail: {document}"
Conclusion: "Generate a concluding statement for the following text: {document}"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reducing Hallucinations
Techniques Implemented:
Beam Search: Used with parameters to generate multiple candidate summaries and select the most likely one.
Prompt Refinement: Adjusted prompts to be specific and clear, reducing ambiguity in the generated content.
Post-Processing Checks: Implemented checks to verify that the generated summaries accurately reflect the content of the document.

8. Defense of Approach
-> Model Choice: BART was selected due to its effectiveness in summarization tasks and its pre-training on similar tasks, ensuring high-quality outputs.
-> Chunking Strategy: Necessary for handling long documents within BART's token limits while maintaining context and coherence through the map-reduce approach.
-> Prompt Engineering: Tailored prompts ensure that the summaries meet specific needs (abstract, summary, conclusion) and guide the model to generate focused outputs.
-> Hallucination Reduction: Techniques like beam search and prompt refinement improve the accuracy and relevance of generated summaries.
-> Parameter Tuning: Adjusting parameters like top-p, top-k, and temperature ensures better control over the output quality, reducing hallucinations and improving coherence.
